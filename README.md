# Commendatore

Commendatore is a **project task manager for weddings**, designed to help couples, planners and vendors keep every detail organized in one place.

## Features

- Centralised wedding task list with due dates and statuses.
- Multiple sections for budget, guests, venue, vendors and timeline.
- Visual overview of upcoming tasks and overdue items.
- Lightweight web interface designed for desktop and mobile use.

## Use cases

- Couples planning their own wedding and needing a simple, structured task manager.
- Wedding planners managing multiple events and wanting a clear task breakdown per wedding.
- Vendors who need to track deliverables, deadlines, and dependencies with the couple or planner.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Modern web stack (e.g. React/TypeScript or similar SPA framework).
- Backend: Optional API or serverless backend for storing tasks, guests, and vendor data.
- Deployment: Suitable for static hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages / Vercel) with a separate backend if necessary, in my case it's Supabase.

## Roadmap

- Calendar view and Gantt-style task visualization.
- Shared access for partners, planners, and vendors.
- Email or notification reminders for key deadlines.
